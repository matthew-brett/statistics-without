## Standing on the YouTube channels of giants

With thanks to John Rauser: [Statistics Without the Agonizing
Pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dnw46eC-0o)

## Assertion

> Teaching statistics by way of mathematics is like teaching philosophy by way
of ancient Greek

(Paraphrased from @wallis1956statistics).

## A problem

## Our data

From [Mosquito, beer
dataset](https://github.com/odsti/datasets/tree/main/mosquito_beer).

```{python}
import numpy as np  # The array library.
import pandas as pd  # Data science library.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Plotting library.

# Load the data file.
mosquitoes = pd.read_csv('data/mosquito_beer.csv')
# Select the measurements after drink (beer or water).
afters = mosquitoes[mosquitoes['test'] == 'after']
# Get the activated values for beer and water.
beers = afters.loc[afters['group'] == 'beer', 'activated'].values
waters = afters.loc[afters['group'] == 'water', 'activated'].values
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
beers
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
waters
```

## Distributions

```{python}
# Plot histograms of beer and water values.
bins = np.arange(0, 38, 2)
plt.hist(beers, bins=bins, alpha=0.5, label='beer')
plt.hist(waters, bins=bins, alpha=0.5, label='water')
plt.title('Distribution of beer and water values')
plt.legend();
```

## Means and difference

```{python}
mean_beer = np.mean(beers)
print(f'Mean of beer values is: {mean_beer:.2f}')
```

```{python}
mean_water = np.mean(waters)
print(f'Mean of water values is: {mean_water:.2f}')
```

```{python}
mean_diff = mean_beer - mean_water
print(f'Mean difference is: {mean_diff:.2f}')
```

## The null hypothesis

Null means "not any".

Define a world in which the difference of interest is set to zero.

> The two samples have been drawn from the same underlying population.

Or:

> There is not any difference in the population from which `beer` has been
drawn, and the population from which `water` has been drawn.

## The t-test.
